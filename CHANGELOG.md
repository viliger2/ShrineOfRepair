<summary>1.4.0 </summary>

* Reworked list extension for mod developers, so if you decide to implement it, your mod won't throw errrors if ShrineOfRepair is not present. It does require a slight rewrite, example can be seen [here](https://github.com/viliger2/ExtradimensionaItems/blob/master/RoR2_ItemsMod/Modules/ShrineOfRepairCompat.cs).
